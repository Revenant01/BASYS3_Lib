# Basys3 Library for Multiple HDL Interfaces and Peripherals

## Introduction

Welcome to the Basys3 Library repository! This open-source project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of hardware description language (HDL) modules that act as interfaces with the Basys3 FPGA development board and handle various peripherals on the board. The library is designed to be versatile and adaptable, supporting multiple HDL languages such as Verilog and VHDL.

## Features

The Basys3 Library comes packed with the following features:

- HDL modules for various interfaces with the Basys3 board, making it easy to interact with the hardware.
- Abstractions for handling peripherals on the Basys3 board, simplifying integration into your projects.
- Support for multiple HDL languages, allowing users to choose their preferred language for implementation.
- Well-documented and thoroughly tested modules to ensure reliability and correctness.
- Easy-to-use API for seamless integration with your FPGA projects.

## Supported HDL Languages

The Basys3 Library currently supports the following HDL languages:

- Verilog
- VHDL
- SystemVerilog

We aim to expand our language support in the future to accommodate a broader range of users.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with the Basys3 Library:

### Prerequisites

To use the Basys3 Library, you will need the following:

- A Basys3 FPGA development board
- An FPGA development environment compatible with your chosen HDL language (Xilinx Vivado for VHDL/Verilog, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/basys3-library.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd basys3-library
```

### Usage

To use the Basys3 Library in your own HDL projects, follow these steps:

1. Choose the appropriate HDL language for your project (Verilog or VHDL).

2. Copy the desired HDL modules from the "src" directory into your project directory.

3. Instantiate and connect the modules in your project's top-level design.

4. Refer to the documentation and examples provided in the "docs" directory for guidance on using specific modules.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the open-source community for their valuable contributions and support.
